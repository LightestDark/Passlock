# Passlock
A web-based password manager demo that checks if you are making thes best password you can!
Passlock is only my third css included project I got a lot of help from youtube, so please forgive me if its not amazing.

I made Passlock since it's a buzzkill having to scroll back on Google for all my passwords and not have it in one place.

Very easy and lightweight, I managed to put it all in one file using a combination of Python for backend, HTML and CSS for the website!

Still working on it up to the 14 hour Quota so stay tuned for updates in the Changelogs!

# Changelogs

1.02 - Got rid of PMG pictures, stuck to emojis so there's less faff in what you need to download, added a section to store passwords internally.

1.03 - Encypted passwords saved on local files, so unless you have the key you cannot access the true passwords

1.04-  Added a scroll sidebar for if you have several passwords
