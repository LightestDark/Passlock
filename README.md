# Passlock
A web-based password manager demo that checks if you are making the  best password you can!
It is two step verified with a master password to even login the website, and all passwords are saved with a weak encryption that i made myself with a key shift in the numbers/letters.

Logic and encryption is all JS.

Passlock is only my third css included project I got a lot of help from youtube, so please forgive me if its not amazing, learnt a lot form W3 schools about encryption to help in my website.

DISCLAIMER - CSS has code i borrowed from a W3 SCHOOLS TUTORIAL THAT I THEN CHANGED TO FIT MY WEBSITE AND MODIFIED SO ITS ORIGINAL INLCUDING THE EMOJIS USED 

I made Passlock since it's a buzzkill having to scroll back on Google for all my passwords and not have it in one place.

Very easy and lightweight, I managed to put it all in one file using a combination of Python for backend, HTML and CSS for the website!

Still working on it up to the 14 hour Quota so stay tuned for updates in the Changelogs!

# Changelogs

1.03 - Encypted passwords saved on local files, so unless you have the key you cannot access the true passwords

1.04-  Added a scroll sidebar for if you have several passwords

1.05 - 04/01/25 - -added night mode, and redid the encryption key from a ceaser shift to something harder.
